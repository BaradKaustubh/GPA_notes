    <br><br><br>It is said that <i>reminiscence</i> of the past should be done as long as it gives pleasure and happiness. And this is what exactly happens with me when I remember my <b>Alma Mater…</b><u>nurturer, my haven</u>, a place I called my own for 5 years. The school has the most important role to play in shaping one’s personality. As far as I am concerned I can very humbly say, I am what I am because of my schooling.

    I am very grateful to my parents for having chosen this institution, which even after 65 years of its existence still stands rock-solid to its motto, <b>‘Truth and Love’</b>. My heart is filled with <i> pride, fondness,   gratitude-coupled </i>with <i>nostalgia</i> and longing as to how those wonderful years flew by.
